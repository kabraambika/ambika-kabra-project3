# ambika-kabra-project3
Twitter clone as final project for web development course

## Project description
The goal of this project is to create an online social media app like Twitter or Facebook that features users status updates.  Your social media app is a website where users can login or register new accounts, make social media posts, create posts, and update/delete those posts.  For the purpose of this assignment an status update is a small amount of text generated by a user (you can choose to limit the length of these status updates if you want).  A status update should be composed of at least a username, timestamp and the text content.
